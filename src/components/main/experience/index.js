            With my experience as an entrepreneur, software engineer, and traveler for the last five years, I bring technical expertise as well as people and cultural skills to the teams I’m on.

          <p>
            I have a bachelors degree in chemical engineering and started learning web application development when I quit my chemical engineering job to start a business. Though the business did not thrive, that decision has led me down a road to teach coding in the Middle East, work for two companies as a software developer including MX, and most recently returning to the Middle East to become conversational in Arabic.
          </p>

            I can hold my own in backend engineering with Ruby, NodeJS and a variety of other technologies. I can also hold my own in a variety of cultures (I speak Spanish too), which could help your business expand into other regions of the world if you are into that. I also am always trying to get better at whatever I’m working on.
